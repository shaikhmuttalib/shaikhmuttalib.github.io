 <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language it was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 , which is the most widely used language on Web to develop web pages.

Web browsers can read HTML files and compose them into visible or audible web pages. Browsers do not display the HTML tags and scripts, but use them to interpret the content of the page. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language </p>.
